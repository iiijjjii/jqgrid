=================
Phase II Proposal
=================


Defaults Based on Table
-----------------------

The jqgrid_options colNames and colModel can be defaulted based on the table.
[ ] Default colNames to the list of table field names in title format.
[ ] Default colModel based on table field names.

So does JqGrid.data(..., field=[...]).
[ ] Default field to the list of table field names


JqGrid in Module
----------------

[ ] Move the JqGrid class to a module.
    applications/jqgrid/modules/jqgrid.py

[ ] Find proper way to pass request and response variables to the module.


Component
---------

[ ] Demonstrate the use of a the JqGrid class as a component (web2py book chapter 13).
[ ] Implementation should be capable for handling multi component in same page.
[ ] A well documented demo is especially needed for this complicated demand.


Simplification
--------------
[ ] No get_rows() is needed anymore, demo() provides needed rows data for itself.



----


All feature is done. Most part of the interface is straight forward, but some
need an explanation. Pay attention to the comments inside the component demo.

Oh one bonus feature for you. Now you have a JQGRID helper, works almost the
same way as other html helpers in web2py. So you can mix JQGRID inside other
html helpers:

    H1('This is a helper'),
    A('Click me', _href='http://...'),
    TABLE(
        TR(JQGRID(...), TD(...)),
        TR(TD(...), TD(...)),
        ),
